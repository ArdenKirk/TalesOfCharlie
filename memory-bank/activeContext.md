## Active Technical Considerations

### Development Workflow Optimization
**Currently**: Manual Docker orchestration via `ops/dev.sh`
**Opportunity**: Could we enhance with:
- Automated database seeding
- Service health monitoring
- Better error reporting during startup

### Content Extraction Architecture
**Current Approach**: Worker-based processing with Mozilla Readability
**Considerations**:
- robots.txt compliance implementation
- SSRF protection strategy
- Content sanitization approach
- Caching of extraction results

### AI Integration Design
**Development Mode**: Deterministic mock responses
**Production Strategy**:
- Budget guarding ($5/day limit)
- Model versioning and caching
- Rate limiting and timeouts
- Fallback behavior for AI failures

## Known Implementation Gaps

### Frontend Architecture
- Basic Next.js App Router setup exists, but:
  - No authentication state management
  - No data fetching patterns established
  - No UI components built
  - No routing structure implemented

### Backend Services
- NestJS skeleton present, but:
  - No API endpoints implemented
  - Authentication middleware missing
  - Database connections untested
  - No business logic implemented

### Worker System
- BullMQ worker files exist, but:
  - No job processors implemented
  - No queue configuration
  - No Redis connection established
  - No article processing logic

### Database Layer
- Prisma schema exists, but:
  - No seed data implemented
  - No migration testing completed
  - No repository patterns established
  - No optimized indexes verified

ðŸš¨ **Domain Management Scale**: Growing from zero to valid domain list

### Mitigation Plans
- **Docker**: Simplify development workflow with helper scripts
- **AI Costs**: Comprehensive caching and rate limiting from day one
- **Domain Management**: Start with curated initial list, implement review workflow

## Communication & Coordination

### Internal Alignment
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + NestJS + BullMQ + Prisma decided
- **AI Strategy**: Mock-first development approach established
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with shared packages agreed
