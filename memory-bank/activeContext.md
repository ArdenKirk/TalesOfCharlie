# Tales Of Charlie - Active Context

## Current Project State

### Immediate Focus (Next 2 Weeks)
âœ… **Memory Bank Initialization** - Complete
- Created core documentation structure
- Documented project architecture and goals
- Established development patterns and standards

### Development Environment Status
ðŸŸ¡ **Basic Setup Complete**
- Monorepo scaffolding with pnpm workspaces
- Docker Compose configuration for local development
- Basic Next.js web app, NestJS API, and Worker service structure
- Prisma schema with core data models
- Development orchestration script (`ops/dev.sh`)

### Quick Development Wins
ðŸŽ¯ **Accessible Near-Term Goals**
- Get complete development stack running locally
- Implement basic article submission functionality
- Build functional user authentication
- Deploy first version to production environment

## Critical Path Forward

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
**Docker Stack Activation**
```bash
cd ops && ./dev.sh up    # Get full stack running
```

**Prerequisites Verification**
- [ ] Database migrations run correctly
- [ ] All services can communicate with each other
- [ ] Basic health check endpoints responding
- [ ] Hot reload working for all services

**Key Questions to Resolve**
- Is the current Docker setup production-ready?
- What optimizations needed for development speed?
- Environment variable management strategy?

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Management (Week 3-4)
**Implement Auth Flow**
- Google OAuth setup in development
- Magic link email authentication
- Profile creation and unique usernames
- Admin user seeding

**Technical Decisions Needed**
- How to handle Google OAuth in local development?
- What are the auth scopes requirements?
- Email service configuration (MailHog for dev)?

### Phase 3: Article Submission Pipeline (Week 5-6)
**Core Article Processing**
- URL submission endpoint with basic validation
- Content extraction service implementation
- Domain whitelist/blacklist check
- Basic response mocking system

**Domain Management Strategy**
- How to implement domain review workflow?
- Should we start with a small curated domain list?
- API contracts for domain validation?

### Phase 4: AI Integration & Moderation (Week 7-8)
**Mock Response System**
- Response Picker UI implementation
- Deterministic test fixtures creation
- Approval/denial flows with mock feedback

**Production AI Strategy**
- LiteLLM proxy configuration
- Budget and rate limiting setup
- Fallback strategies for AI failures

## Active Technical Considerations

### Development Workflow Optimization
**Currently**: Manual Docker orchestration via `ops/dev.sh`
**Opportunity**: Could we enhance with:
- Automated database seeding
- Service health monitoring
- Better error reporting during startup

### Content Extraction Architecture
**Current Approach**: Worker-based processing with Mozilla Readability
**Considerations**:
- robots.txt compliance implementation
- SSRF protection strategy
- Content sanitization approach
- Caching of extraction results

### AI Integration Design
**Development Mode**: Deterministic mock responses
**Production Strategy**:
- Budget guarding ($5/day limit)
- Model versioning and caching
- Rate limiting and timeouts
- Fallback behavior for AI failures

## Known Implementation Gaps

### Frontend Architecture
- Basic Next.js App Router setup exists, but:
  - No authentication state management
  - No data fetching patterns established
  - No UI components built
  - No routing structure implemented

### Backend Services
- NestJS skeleton present, but:
  - No API endpoints implemented
  - Authentication middleware missing
  - Database connections untested
  - No business logic implemented

### Worker System
- BullMQ worker files exist, but:
  - No job processors implemented
  - No queue configuration
  - No Redis connection established
  - No article processing logic

### Database Layer
- Prisma schema exists, but:
  - No seed data implemented
  - No migration testing completed
  - No repository patterns established
  - No optimized indexes verified

## Recent Changes & Progress

### Infrastructure Setup
âœ… **Monorepo Structure**: Complete with pnpm workspaces
âœ… **Docker Architecture**: Services configured but untested
âœ… **Package Organization**: Apps and packages scaffolded

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
ðŸš¨ **Docker Complexity**: Complex multi-service setup could be difficult for new contributors
ðŸš¨ **AI Budget Management**: Budget-governed AI in production with potential costs
ðŸš¨ **Domain Management Scale**: Growing from zero to valid domain list

### Mitigation Plans
- **Docker**: Simplify development workflow with helper scripts
- **AI Costs**: Comprehensive caching and rate limiting from day one
- **Domain Management**: Start with curated initial list, implement review workflow

## Communication & Coordination

### Internal Alignment
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + NestJS + BullMQ + Prisma decided
- **AI Strategy**: Mock-first development approach established
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with shared packages agreed

### External Dependencies
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean Droplet selected
- **AI Providers**: LiteLLM proxy for multi-provider support
- **OAuth**: Google + email magic links strategy

## Productivity Insights

### What Makes Us Effective
- **Clear Vision**: Project goals and editorial line well-defined
- **Structured Approach**: Monorepo organization with clear separation
- **Developer-First Tools**: Hot reload, comprehensive tooling, Docker parity

### Areas for Improvement
- **Development Speed**: Loop optimization for faster iteration
- **Testing Setup**: Early adoption of comprehensive testing patterns
- **Deployment Automation**: Zero-touch production deployments

## Decision Framework

### When Making Technical Choices
1. **Favor Developer Experience**: Choose tools that make development faster
2. **Maintain Performance**: Optimize for speed and scalability
3. **Ensure Reliability**: Build with error handling and resilience
4. **Stay Professional**: Balanced approach despite partisan content
