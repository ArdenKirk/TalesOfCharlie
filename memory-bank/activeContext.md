### Content Extraction Architecture ✅
**✅ Implemented Approach**: Worker-based processing with Mozilla Readability
**✅ Safety Features**:
- robots.txt compliance implementation
- SSRF protection strategy
- Content sanitization approach
- Caching of extraction results

### Development vs Production AI
**✅ Development Mode**: Deterministic mock responses with Response Picker (planned)
**✅ Production Mode**: 
- Real LiteLLM service with budget guarding
- Model routing and fallback strategies
- Rate limiting and cost monitoring
- Response caching for performance

## Known Implementation Gaps

### Frontend Architecture
- Basic Next.js App Router setup exists, but:
  - No data fetching patterns established for article display
  - Article display components need implementation
  - No routing structure for article pages

### Response Picker UI (Development)
- Mock AI system exists but needs developer UI:
  - Interactive response selection interface
  - Visual preview of AI decisions
  - Easy switching between mock scenarios

### Domain Management System
- Backend logic needs implementation:
  - Domain review workflow
  - Administrative approval interface
  - Community submission forms

### Database Layer
- Prisma schema exists, but:
  - No seed data implemented
  - No migration testing completed
  - No repository patterns established
  - No optimized indexes verified
