  - Easy switching between mock scenarios

### Domain Management System
- Backend logic needs implementation:
  - Domain review workflow
  - Administrative approval interface
  - Community submission forms

### Database Layer
- Prisma schema exists, but:
  - No seed data implemented
  - No migration testing completed
  - No repository patterns established
  - No optimized indexes verified
