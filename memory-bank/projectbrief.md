# Tales Of Charlie - Project Brief

## Mission Statement
Tales of Charlie is a media aggregation platform that exposes corruption and bias in liberal media against conservatives, the white race, and groups often maligned by the left. The platform serves as a tribute to Charlie Kirk while providing a professional news experience.

## Core Philosophy
- **Uncompromising Editorial Line**: Copy headlines and ledes verbatim, then summarize remainders from an extremely conservative perspective
- **Professional Presentation**: Format everything to look like a serious news publication despite the partisan summaries
- **Text-Only Approach**: No images to maintain focus on content
- **AI-Powered Moderation**: Long-term goal of AI handling intake, validation, and moderation autonomously
- **Community Governance**: Users can submit domains for review to expand approved sources

## Target Audience
Conservative readers seeking reliable news aggregation and bias documentation, from both right-leaning sources reporting favorable facts and left-leaning sources documenting egregious bias.

## Key Principles
- **Fair Use Compliance**: Verbatim headline/lede copying with linked sources
- **Safety First**: Respect robots.txt, avoid paywall circumvention
- **Performance Focus**: Optimized for speed and scalability
- **Developer Experience**: Docker-based local development with parity between environments

## Scope Boundaries
- Text-only content, no image processing or storage
- Conservative perspective summaries only
- Professional news formatting
- Domain blacklist/whitelist system
- User moderation and reporting features

## Success Metrics
- High-quality, defensible content aggregation
- Fast, reliable performance
- Scalable architecture supporting growth
- Robust moderation against spam/abuse
- Developer-friendly contribution process
